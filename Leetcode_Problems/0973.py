# LeetCode 0973 - K Closest Points to Origin
# Medium - Heap / Priority Queue
# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
# You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

# Iterative Solution with Min Heap
# Complexities:
# Time : O(k * logn)
# Space: O(n)
